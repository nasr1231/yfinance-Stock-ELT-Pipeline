# yfinance-Stock-ELT-Pipeline
This project implements a modern ELT pipeline to ingest historical financial market data from Yahoo Finance, store it in Snowflake (Data Lake), process and transform with Apache Spark, and load data into a PostgreSQL Data Warehouse for analytics and reporting. All services are fully containerized with Docker and orchestrated using Apache Airflow.
